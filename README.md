# Escape-to-the-Stars
Text based game built in Python and ported to C++ 

This is the C++ version of Escape to the Stars. 

It does not work as intended, and is a work in progress

This game was built in Python as the final project of an intro to programming class.

I ported it to C++ as the final project of a later programming course. 

# Refactoring in progress
This game needs a complete refactor as it does not work as intended and in fact does not work at all

OO Principles and Patterns will be used to make the code readable and functional.
